What's goin' on, Mama?
Something just dawned on me
I ain't been home in some months
Been chasin' songs and women
Makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much
Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93
I thought you should know
That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know
Thought you should know
Thought you should know
Oh, by the way, Momma, didn't mean to ramble on ya
How's everything back at home?
Yeah, how's that garden comin'?
Is dad still doing dumb shit?
And how'd he keep you this long?
Yeah, I'm sorry that I called you so late
I just miss you but anyways
I thought you should know
That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
I got me a new girl down in Jefferson City, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know
Thought you should know
Thought you should know
Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me
You've been losing sleep since '93
I thought you should know
That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
That I really like this girl down in Jefferson City, and
It turns out she's a lot like you
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
The bus is leavin' so I gotta roll
Just thought you should know
Thought you should know
Thought you should know
I thought you should know
Thought you should know
I thought you should know
Thought you should know
Thought you should know
