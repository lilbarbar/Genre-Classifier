This whole world on fire
Feels like a bad dream
Did the hammer come down?
Feels like a kick in the teeth
All this down on my luck
Has been gettin' me down on my knees
Might have been something I need
'Cause I been chasin
Rat racin'
Doin' anything to win
My grass looks like Augusta
And I got around to paintin' that fence
I been callin' up my mama doin' some old friend checkin' in
It seems like where I'm going might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
I found some right in all this wrong
And I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me
I got a little less in the bank
I get a little more sleep
I get a little more use out of that old porch swing
I got a little more her holdin' on to little more me
I feel a little more free
'Cause I been chasin
Rat racin'
Doin' anything to win
My grass looks like Augusta
And I got around to paintin' that fence
I been callin' up my mama doin' some old friend checkin' in
And it seems like where I'm going might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
I'm findin' right in all this wrong
And I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me
Knows better than me
If the world does end
I'll take the last day slow
If He does come back
I know where I'll go
And if He takes His time
Well I've learned one thing
The good Lord knows better than me
'Cause I been chasin
Rat racin'
Doin' anything to win
I've made more time for fishin'
I got my old truck runnin' again
I went home to see my mama been good hearing from old friends
And it seems like where I'm going might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
I found the writin' on the wall
And I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me
Better than me
So much better than me
