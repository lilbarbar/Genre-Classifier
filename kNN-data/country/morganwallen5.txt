Yeah, you used to talk about getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now, long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder when you're drinking if you find yourself thinking
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better, but we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river and sippin' on a Sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know that was seven summers ago?
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway
But I wonder when you're drinking if you find yourself thinking
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better, but we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
