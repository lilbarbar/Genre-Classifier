As we sat on the front porch of that old gray house
Where I was born and raised
Staring at the dusty fields, where my daddy worked hard everyday
I think it kinda hurt him when I said
"Daddy, there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life, where corn don't grow?"
He just sat there silent, staring at his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes, when he looked up
He said "Son, I know at your age, it seems like this ole world is turnin' slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all, where corn don't grow"
Let me tell you something
Hard times are real
Th–µre's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind, 'cause the weeds are high
Where corn don't grow
I remember feeling guilty
When daddy turned, and walked back in the house
And I was only 17 back then
But I thought that I knew more than I know now
I can't say he didn't warn me
This city life's a hard row to hoe
Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around, where corn don't grow
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind, 'cause the weeds are high
Where corn don't grow
You may change your mind
'Cause oh, the weeds are high, where corn don't grow
