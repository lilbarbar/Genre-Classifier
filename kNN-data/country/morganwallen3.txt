I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
