I was all but 22, I think at the time
I'd been out on the road, lonely at night
And it'd been a while, so it was on my mind
Well, I saw him walk in, with his cowboy hat
And I thought to myself, I could use some of that
His boots like glass on a sawdust floor, huh
Had moves like nothing I'd ever seen before
So I walked right up, and I pulled him to the side
I handed that man a beer and looked him in the eyes
And I said, "Baby, I think you're gonna wanna hear this"
Then I told him
"Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And baby, I don't blame you
For looking me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me"
Well, I was down at a local beer joint with a few of the guys
When this cute little country girl caught my eye
And boy, let me tell you, she was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen in a pair of boots
Well, she walked right up to me, handed me a beer
Gave me a look like, "Let's get out of here"
And that's when I realized that she was every cowboy's dream come true
She told me this right here, she said
"Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And baby, I don't blame you
For looking me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me"
Alright now
So if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat
And you think to yourself, I could use some of that
Don't waste your time
Just give him this here line
Goes a little like this
"Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me to want you to come on home
And baby, I don't blame you
For looking me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like you love me
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave
And you look like love me"
