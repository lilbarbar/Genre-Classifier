Take me to the box, Bandicoot, let me crash
Ooh, make me sleep, make me dream, make me snore

Thank you, Lord
'Member eatin' dinner, kitchen drawers full of sporks
I was always wantin' to try and go over my aunt's
Sugar in the 'frigerator right next to the ants
I would make the Kool-Aid then go make a cooler dance
Since I was a shorty nigga always wore the pants

Put some water on the grass to make it grow
I like her skin all black like a crow (Just like a crow)

I text a kiddy and she text me back hello
I'm like Simply Lemonade
I'ma play my cards right
I ain't talkin' spades, they should be afraid
Money growin' on the tree, it's gon' call a shade
Please, can you hold on

'Cause me and Chance ain't gon' take long
'Cause me and Chance ain't gon' take long
