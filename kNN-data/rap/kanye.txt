Work it, make it, do it
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger
Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster
I need you right now
Makes us stronger more than ever
Hour after, our work is never over
I need you right now
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a f- what they all say right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake sh-
So go ahead, go nuts, go apesh-
Especially in my pastel on my bape sh-
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homie, take six, and take this, haters
Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster
I need you right now
Makes us stronger more than ever
Hour after, our work is never over
I need you right now (me likey)
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment right?
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde-dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster
I need you right now
Makes us stronger more than ever
Hour after, our work is never over
I need you right now
You know how long I've been on you?

Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Don't act like I never told you
Baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster
