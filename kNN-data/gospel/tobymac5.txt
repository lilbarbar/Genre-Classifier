I was feelin' that, feelin' that breeze
Singin' like a song through the tall oak trees
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment
I was young and runnin' wide open
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered to You, You
Uh, You were there, You heard my prayer
In that broke-down, dusty room
It was the first time I said, "I'm Yours"
The first time I called You "Lord"
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through
Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
Sang like a song through the oak trees
Pennsylvania, she kind of caught my soul
Which had me a little more open than closed
Walls I built, opinions I learned
Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned
Blind to the arrow that was headed to my heart
But You hit the mark
When love broke through (love)
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert (desert)
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken (thank you, Jesus)
And it all began with You (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert (desert)
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken (chains are broken)
And it all began with You
When love broke through (it all began with You, it all began with You)
And it all began with You
When love broke through (it all began with You, Jesus)
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me, mm
