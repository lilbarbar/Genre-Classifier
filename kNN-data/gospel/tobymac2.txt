It may be midnight or midday
Never early, never late
He gon' stand by what He claim
Lived enough life to say
I heard your heart
I see your pain
Out in the dark
Out in the rain
Feel so alone
Feel so afraid
I heard you pray in Jesus' name
It may be midnight or midday
It's never early, never late
He gon' stand by what He claim
I've lived enough life to say
Help is on the way (roundin' the corner)
Help is on the way (comin' for ya)
Help is on the way (yeah, yeah)
I've lived enough life to say
Help is on the way
Sometimes it's days
Sometimes it's years
Some face a lifetime of falling tears
But He's in the darkness
He's in the cold
Just like the morning, He always shows
It may be midnight or midday
It's never early, never late
He gon' stand by what He claim
I've lived enough life to say
Help is on the way (roundin' the corner)
Help is on the way (comin' for ya)
Help is on the way (yeah, yeah)
I've lived enough life to say
Help is on the way
Well I've seen my share of troubles
But the Lord ain't failed me yet
So I'm holding on to the promise y'all
That He's rolling up His sleeves again
Said I've seen my share of troubles
But the Lord ain't failed me yet
We'll keep holding on to the promise y'all
That He's rolling up His sleeves again
Don't you know it
(Rolling up his sleeves again)
I can see him rolling
(Rolling up, rolling up)
Help is coming
(Rolling up his sleeves again)
It may be midnight or midday
He's never early, no never late
He gon' stand by what He claim
I've lived enough life to say
It may be midnight or midday
It's never early, never late
He gon' stand by what He claim
I've lived enough life to say
Help is on the way
Help is on the way (roundin' the corner)
Help is on the way
