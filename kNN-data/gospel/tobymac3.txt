Woke up 'cause the light poured in (light poured in)
Day two, let the flood begin
Day one left me in my bed (in my bed)
I can barely remember it
Heart shattered in a thousand ways
They tell me pain gonna come in waves (come in waves)
They tell me I'm gonna be okay (be okay)
Still waitin' for the first to break
Why would You give and then take him away?
Suddenly end, could You not let it fade?
What I would give for a couple o' days (couple o' days)
A couple o' days
Is it just across the Jordan
Or a city in the stars?
Are ya singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are?
Well, until this show is over
And you've run into my arms
God has you in Heaven
But I have you in my heart
I have you in my heart
I just can't make sense of this (sense of this)
Everything is so dissonant (so dissonant)
Somebody said, "He was meant for this" (meant for this)
But I'm just straight missin' him
I wanna wake up to your laugh at two (laugh at two)
Catch ya when you steal my shoes (steal my shoes)
Say, "Good mornin', afternoon" (afternoon)
Talk ya through those "Alex blues" (Alex blues)
Listen to your latest beats (latest beats)
Talk about what the lyrics mean
Venmo you another loan ('nother loan)
See ya do your second show
You said, "You'd turn, you would turn it around" (turn it around)
Thought that you had time to straighten it out (straighten it out)
Told me that you were my prodigal son
But this isn't home
Is it just across the Jordan
Or a city in the stars?
Are ya singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are?
Well, until this show is over
And you've run into my arms
God has you in Heaven
But I have you in my heart
I have you in my heart
Did he see You from a long way off (did he see you?)
Runnin' to him with a father's heart? (Runnin' to him)
Did You wrap him up inside Your arms
And let him know that he's home?
Did he see You from a long way off
Runnin' to him with a father's heart?
Did You wrap him up inside Your arms
And let him know that he's home?
Is it just across the Jordan
Or a city in the stars? (City in the stars)
Are ya singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are? (Happy where you are)
Well, until this show is over
And you've run into my arms (run into my arms)
God has you in Heaven
21 years makes a man full-grown
21 years, what a beautiful loan
21 years, I love everyone (love everyone)
Thank you Lord for my beautiful son (beautiful son)
