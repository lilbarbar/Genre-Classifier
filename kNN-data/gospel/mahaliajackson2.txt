There are some things
I may not know, ooh-ooh
And there are some places
Oh Lord, I cannot go
But I am sure
Of this one thing
That God is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

Yes, God is real
Oh, He's real in my soul
Yes, God is real
For He has washed
And made me whole
Ooh, His love for me
Is just like pure gold, ooh Lord
My God is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul
Yes, God is real
Oh yes, God is real in my soul
Yes, God is real
For He has washed
And made me whole
Ooh, His love for me
You know it just like pure gold
Oh, yes
Yes, God is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul
