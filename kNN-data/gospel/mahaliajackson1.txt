Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
Through the storm
Through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord
And lead me home
When my way grows drear
Precious Lord, linger near
When my life is almost gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand, precious Lord
And lead me home
