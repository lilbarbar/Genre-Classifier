El Shaddai, El Shaddai
El Elyon na Adonai
Age to age You're still the same
By the power of the name
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
Erkamka na Adonai
We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai

Through Your love and through the ram
You saved the son of Abraham
Through the power of Your hand
Turned the sea into dry land
To the outcast on her knees
You were the God who really sees
And by Your might
You set Your children free

El Shaddai, El Shaddai
El Elyon na Adonai
Age to age You're still the same
By the power of the name
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
Erkamka na Adonai
We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai

Through the years You made it clear
That the time of Christ was near
Though the people couldn't see
What Messiah ought to be
Though Your Word contained the plan
They just could not understand
Your most awesome work was done
Through the frailty of Your Son

El Shaddai, El Shaddai
El Elyon na Adonai
Age to age You're still the same (Ooh, ooh)
By the power of the name (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
El Shaddai, El Shaddai (Ooh)
Erkamka na Adonai
I will praise You (Praise You) 'til I die, El Shaddai
El Shaddai, El Shaddai (Ooh)
El Elyon na Adonai
Age to age You're still the same (Ooh, ooh)
By the power of the name (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
El Shaddai, El Shaddai (Ooh)
Erkamka na Adonai
I will praise You (Praise You) 'til I die, El Shaddai
