Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you just how much
Good that it's gonna do you
Just to sing
Anew
The song your heart learned to sing
When He first gave His life to you
But life goes on and so must the song
You gotta sing again
The song born in your soul when
You first gave your heart to Him
Sing His praises once more
Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more Hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you just how much
Good that it's gonna do you
Just to sing
Aloud the song that someone is dying
To hear down in the maddening crowd
As you once were before you heard the song
You gotta let them know the truth
Is a life to shine upon the way, so maybe they, can go
Sing your praises once more
Sing your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more Hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you just how much
Good that it's gonna do you
Just to let the name of the Lord
Be praised both for now and ever more
Praise Him oh you servants
Give your praise to the Lord
Come on everybody
Stand up and sing one more Hallelujah
Give your praise to the Lord
I can never tell you just how much
Good that it's gonna do you
Just to sing, sing, sing
Come on, sing, sing, sing
I can hear you now, sing, sing, sing
